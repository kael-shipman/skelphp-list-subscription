# ListSubscription

A very basic class for managing opt-ins for subscriptions. I use this as an easy way to receive, validate and save input for mailing list management. I can then pass it on to a mailing list SDK object on successful save to sync the subscription changes to a third-party mailing list like MailChimp.
